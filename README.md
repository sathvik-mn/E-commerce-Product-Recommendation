# E-commerce Product Recommendation

A well-developed recommendation system can significantly enhance a customer's shopping experience on an e-commerce platform, leading to better customer acquisition and retention. The recommendation system described below is designed to cater to new customers and those with a purchase history, and it also considers scenarios where the business has no prior purchase data. The system is divided into three parts:

## Recommendation System Overview
1. Popularity-Based Recommendation System (Targeted at New Customers)
2. Model-Based Collaborative Filtering System (Based on Purchase History and Ratings)
3. Text-Based Clustering Recommendation System (For Businesses with No Purchase Data)

## Part I: Popularity-Based Recommendation System
For new customers visiting the e-commerce website for the first time, recommending the most popular products is an effective strategy. This approach uses the popularity of products based on the number of ratings they have received.

### Steps:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning: Load and clean the data to ensure there are no missing values.
2. Identify Most Popular Products: Group the products by their ID and count the number of ratings for each product to determine their popularity.
3. Visualization: Create a bar chart to display the most popular products in descending order of their ratings, which can be recommended to new customers.

## Part II: Model-Based Collaborative Filtering System
Once a customer has made a purchase, recommendations can be refined using collaborative filtering techniques. This method recommends items to users based on their purchase history and the similarity of ratings provided by other users.

### Steps:

1. Utility Matrix Creation: Create a utility matrix from the subset of data where rows represent users, columns represent products, and values represent ratings.
2. Matrix Decomposition: Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the utility matrix into its constituent components.
3. Correlation Matrix: Compute the correlation matrix to find similarities between products.
4. Recommendation Logic: When a customer buys a specific product, identify products with a high correlation to the purchased item and recommend them.

## Part III: Text-Based Clustering Recommendation System
For businesses without any user-item purchase history, recommendations can be made based on product descriptions using textual clustering analysis. This approach leverages the content of product descriptions to recommend similar products.

### Steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the product descriptions and remove any missing values.
2. Vectorization and Clustering: Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert the text data into numerical features, and then apply K-means clustering to group similar products.
3. Visualization and Analysis: Visualize the clusters to understand the grouping and identify top words in each cluster to recommend related products based on textual similarity.

## Conclusion
This recommendation system ensures that new customers are initially engaged with popular products, while returning customers receive personalized recommendations based on their and others' purchase histories. For businesses starting their e-commerce journey without purchase data, a text-based clustering approach ensures relevant product recommendations, enhancing the overall shopping experience.
